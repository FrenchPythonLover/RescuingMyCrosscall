RescuingMyCrosscall: 
I document my adventure trying to revive my bricked Crosscall Trekker M1 Core 
<br>

# how it all started
So a very long time ago (probably when i was 7), i bricked my dad's trekker m1 core while trying to flash a magisk patched boot.img from "A crosscall trekker m1 core stock rom"... which was apparently a hisense rom.<br><br>
I was trying everything to unbrick it, but in doing so i did some things that i... regret (erasing system partition for example). I then left it in a drawer thinking the phone is dead for 2 years<br><br>I am now 9, just got my soldering kit, which contained a pair of tweezers (It's going to matter pretty soon), in a random 3am motivation, i searched for some sort of magical solution, I then discovered the holy **EDL MODE**: An emergency flashing mode which can always flash a rom to a phone without limitation.In my phone it was triggered by short circuiting two pads with a pair of **tweezers**. it basically rendered the phone unbrickable, as long as i have the stock rom, **which i don't**...
<br><br>
# How to get the rom?
My first idea was to send the phone to the aftermaket service of crosscall, the *SAV* as we say in french.<br>
The thing is, its gonna cost 75â‚¬ to do so, as the phone lost it's warranty a while ago.<br>
Me, not ready to pay this amount first tried to research for stock rom on the internet, there were none.<br>
So i brought up my plan B: **Ask nicely**, it didn't work ðŸ¥²
i then re left it in my drawer for 3 other years sometimes trying to flash rom from phones with the same chipset, but it did not work.

# Going bare bones
We're here, 5 years after the incident, im now 12 and i'm much more skilled in the field of IT, notably by compiling linux for a set top box and getting output over hdmi, hacking a picture frame and even rooting and modifiying the bootloader of a cheap klipad KL638DK tablet.<br>
While browsing on the net, i stumbled into an info that fired a spark inside me: Crosscall released KERNEL SOURCES for their more modern phones !! I then knew what i had to do: ask crosscall for the kernel source of the trekker m1 core, in theory with a kernel i could make my very own minimalistic android rom.<br><br>
**ATM, I am waiting for the response to my mail, in which you can find a french copy on the MAIL.txt file. the mail was sent the 13 august of 2025.**
